    <!-- <p>In my journey as an engineer, I had the privilege of being part of early-stage projects where I wore many hats, from building the foundation 
    of a product to iterating on solutions based on user feedback. This experience taught me that building great products is not just about writing code, 
    but about understanding the bigger picture — how systems interact, how users engage, and how to move from idea to execution.</p>
    <p>  
    Today, I am excited to apply that mindset in the world of <strong>Product Management</strong>. With a focus on <strong>user-centric product design</strong> and a passion for creating solutions that truly make a difference, I’m looking for opportunities to help shape products from the ground up.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product Management:</strong> User Research, Market Analysis, Story Telling.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Python, C++, C# </li>
      <li><strong>Tinkerer Mentality:</strong> Curiosity, focus on root cause and trying fast and fail fast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>I'm always eager to learn and grow in product. <br/>Here is <a href="https://adigeak.github.io/">blog</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/AdityaSRathore">resume.</a>.</strong></p> -->
    <p>Hi, I'm Aditya. At my core, I'm a builder.
    My journey from entrepreneur to full-stack engineer and now into product has equipped me with a 360-degree view of what it takes to bring an idea to life(building 0 to 1 products). I have a grasp of user experience, engineering, and business strategy—enough to know what needs to be done, when to do it myself, and when to bring in an expert.
    My passion is leading the charge: unifying these different elements and guiding a team to build and deliver an exceptional product.
      <ul>
      <li>As an entrepreneur: I founded a food delivery startup in college, learning the fundamentals of market validation, operations, and customer acquisition firsthand.</li>
      <li>As a full-stack engineer: I joined a startup as an early member and grew to Senior Software Engineer, helping to scale the company's technology and products through their critical growth phase.</li>
      <li>As a product builder: I have a proven track record of building 0-to-1 products, having led the end-to-end development of both hardware (X-ray gauge) and software (HMI design).</li>
      <li>As a consultant: Through freelance work, I've designed custom software solutions for clients, sharpening my ability to translate business requirements into technical architecture.</li>
      <li>As a product leader: Currently, I am formalizing my extensive practical experience in my Master's program in Product Design and Management at IIIT Hyderabad, mastering the frameworks needed to build and launch successful products strategically.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills: Product Management | Product Roadmap | UX research | Analytics | Agile | Storytelling | Automation of boring stuff  | Product Development | A/B Experimentation | Python | C++</p>
    <p>I'm always eager to learn and grow. Let's connect!</p>
