    <p>In my journey as an engineer, I had the privilege of being part of early-stage projects where I wore many hats, from building the foundation 
    of a product to iterating on solutions based on user feedback. This experience taught me that building great products is not just about writing code, 
    but about understanding the bigger picture — how systems interact, how users engage, and how to move from idea to execution.</p>
    <p>  
    Today, I am excited to apply that mindset in the world of <strong>Product Management</strong>. With a focus on <strong>user-centric product design</strong> and a passion for creating solutions that truly make a difference, I’m looking for opportunities to help shape products from the ground up.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product Management:</strong> User Research, Market Analysis, Story Telling.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Python, C++, C# </li>
      <li><strong>Tinkerer Mentality:</strong> Curiosity, focus on root cause and trying fast and fail fast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>I'm always eager to learn and grow in product. <br/>Here is <a href="https://adigeak.github.io/">blog</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/AdityaSRathore">resume.</a>.</strong></p>
