## Project Overview

Poor posture is a pervasive problem, particularly for those spending long hours working at desks or engaging in sedentary activities. This project aimed to address the issue by creating a wearable posture-monitoring vest integrated with a table unit for real-time analytics and actionable insights. The system is designed to improve posture, reduce strain, and foster healthy habits.

## Our Solution

We developed a system combining a **wearable vest** with **a table unit hub** that monitors posture in real-time and provides advanced analytics to encourage corrective action.

1. **The Wearable Vest**
   1. Equipped with 2 on the shoulders —it tracks slouching and posture dynamics.  
   2. It’s lightweight, comfortable, and designed for hours of wear without causing irritation.  
2. **The Table Unit**  
   1. Acts as a central hub for **data collection** and **analytics visualization.**  
   2. Delivers actionable feedback to the user, with potential applications for workplace wellness programs.

## Development Journey

- **Iteration & Innovation**: We started with 2 IMUs and homemade flex sensors but found the results too noisy. After several iterations, we refined the system to include 4 sensors for more accurate tracking.  
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Using a combination of sewing machines, 3D printing, and soldering, we created 5 working prototypes in just 2 months.  
- **Simplification**: Feedback from mentors helped us focus on **slouch detection**, ensuring the system did one thing and did it exceptionally well.  
- **DIY Excellence**: From building a custom battery pack to integrating two ESP microcontrollers into a compact case, every aspect of the product was thoughtfully designed and executed.

My Role

- Problem identification and ideation  
- Brainstorming and prototyping the wearable vest and table unit  
- Sensor integration and hardware assembly  
- Developing the analytics engine and user feedback loop  
- Iterative testing and refinement

## Key Outcomes

- **Reliable Posture Tracking:** Integration of 4 sensors (2 on shoulders and 2 on the spine) to accurately detect slouching.  
- **Advanced Analytics:** The table unit collects posture data, visualizes it, and delivers actionable feedback to users.  
- **Simplified Design:** Focused on slouch detection, ensuring the system excels at its core function.  
- **Prototyping Milestones:** Completed 5 iterations in 2 months using sewing machines, 3D printing, and custom-built battery packs.  
- **Scalable Design:** Modular system allows for further integration and scalability for workplace wellness programs.

## Lessons Learned

- **Do One Thing Well:** Focusing on slouch detection helped us deliver a highly reliable and effective product.  
- **User-Centric Iteration:** Feedback loops and rapid prototyping ensured the product met real-world needs.  
- **Attention to Detail:** From the hardware to analytics, every element impacts the user's experience.  
- **Empathy-Driven Design:** Understanding the user's pain points was critical to designing a meaningful solution.
