## From Missteps to Meaningful Design — A User Research Journey

A focused research project exploring the lived experiences of older adults living alone. Using design thinking, we identified core pain points (financial dependence, loneliness, safety) and iterated on solutions grounded in ethical, reliable research.

## My Role

- Led primary and secondary research
- Conducted user interviews and contextual inquiries
- Created personas, empathy maps, and journey maps
- Prototyped solutions and ran usability tests

## Process (high level)

1. Desk research → hypothesis formation  
2. User recruitment and interviews  
3. Synthesis: personas, empathy & journey maps  
4. Prototyping → usability testing → iteration

## What went wrong — and how we fixed it

### Mistake 1 — Wrong interview method

We began with semi-structured interviews which produced inconsistent data across participants.  
Fix: Switched to structured interviews to ensure comparable, less-biased responses.

### Mistake 2 — Overlooking privacy

An early user profile exposed a participant's real name, location, and photo.  
Fix: Immediately anonymized data — pseudonyms (e.g., "Resilient Amma"), general locations (e.g., "metro City"), and AI-generated images.

### Mistake 3 — Biased questions

The initial questionnaire included leading and double-barreled questions that risked skewing results.  
Fix: Rewrote the questionnaire with neutral, open-ended questions to capture authentic user stories.

## Key outcomes

- Deep insight into priorities: independence and social connection are central concerns for older adults living alone.  
- Persona developed: "Compelling Radhika" — a 72-year-old retired principal coping with isolation after her spouse's passing; used as a design compass.  
- Solution concept: Silver Companion — a mobile app focused on reducing loneliness and improving safety. Core features:
  - AI Companion & Mood Tracker — emotional support + well‑being monitoring  
  - Family Quick Connect & SOS — easy contact and emergency support  
  - Community Events Calendar — local activities to encourage social engagement
