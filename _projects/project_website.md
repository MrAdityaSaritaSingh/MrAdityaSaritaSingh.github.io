## Project Overview

In today's digital world, a personal website is more than a resume—it's a product. This project is the ongoing development of my personal digital presence, `adityasrathore.com`. The goal was to create a central hub that not only showcases my work but also reflects my skills in product thinking, UX, and technical implementation. I treated this website as a product, with myself as the primary stakeholder and potential recruiters, collaborators, and readers as the target users.

## My Role: The Product Manager

As the sole developer and product manager for this site, I was responsible for the entire lifecycle:

-   **Strategy & Discovery:** Defining the "why" behind the website. I identified the core user need: a clear, concise, and engaging way for visitors to understand my professional story and capabilities.
-   **UX & Design:** Structuring the information architecture to be intuitive. I focused on a clean, scannable layout that guides the user through my journey, from my bio to my detailed project case studies.
-   **Technical Implementation:** Choosing and customizing the technology. I selected the **Jekyll** static site generator and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme for its balance of powerful features and customization flexibility.
-   **Analytics & Iteration:** Integrating analytics to understand user behavior. I implemented **Google Analytics** and **PostHog** to track user engagement, identify popular content, and gather insights for future improvements.

## Key Features & Outcomes

-   **Centralized Professional Hub:** The website successfully consolidates my resume, portfolio, and case studies into a single, cohesive narrative.
-   **Responsive & Accessible Design:** The site is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
-   **Data-Driven Insights:**
    -   **Google Analytics:** Provides high-level traffic metrics, user demographics, and acquisition channels.
    -   **PostHog:** Enables deeper, more granular analysis with features like session recordings and heatmaps, allowing me to see exactly how users are interacting with the content.
-   **Continuous Improvement Loop:** The analytics data provides a constant feedback loop, allowing me to treat the website as a living product that can be iteratively improved based on real user behavior.

## Future Scope

My goal is to continue iterating on this "product." Future plans include:
-   **A/B Testing:** Experimenting with different headlines and calls-to-action to optimize engagement.
-   **Content Strategy:** Using analytics to identify which topics resonate most with my audience and creating more of that content.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Continuously improving page load times and the overall user experience.

This project is a testament to my belief that **product thinking can be applied to anything**—even your own digital identity.
