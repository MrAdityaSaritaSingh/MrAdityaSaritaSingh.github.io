#### Introduction

Hi, I'm Aditya ([01100001ditya](https://twitter.com/01100001ditya)), I'm a software engineer turned into product manager with experience in C,C++ and python, But i always consider my self as tinker with hacker mentality. One who is curious about thing and system. From an early age, I have been driven by a fascination for making and breaking things.
