## Project Overview

Ather Energy faces an uncomfortable truth: the sustainable mobility they provide often relies on raw materials, like cobalt, mined under appalling conditions and involving child labor in the DRC. To address this, **"Project RayTracer"** was conceptualized to pierce the fog of fragmented global supply chains. This project outlines a process-driven solution to ensure clean mobility does not come at a human cost, focusing on tracing every gram of material to provide riders with "guilt-free journeys".

## My Role

*   **Analyzing the value chain** to understand the pain points of consumers, brand teams, supply chain managers, suppliers, and auditors.
*   **Refining the problem statement** to focus on ethical sourcing, traceability, and transparent communication.
*   **Conducting an "Impact vs. Effort" analysis** to prioritize high-value problems like provenance verification and consumer claim substantiation.
*   **Designing the "Project RayTracer" solution architecture**, including digital batching and audit readiness tools.
*   **Developing a 90-day pilot implementation plan** and risk mitigation strategies.

## Key Outcomes

### Refined Problem Statement
*   **Identified the core challenge:** How to redesign raw-material sourcing to ensure every batch is ethically sourced, fully traceable, and transparently communicated without imposing unsustainable burdens on suppliers.
*   **Established the North Star goal** of shifting Ather from a "promise-based system to a proof-based system".

### Stakeholder Analysis
*   **Consumers:** Face a trust gap and cannot verify if materials are ethically sourced.
*   **Supply Chain Managers (Priya):** Struggle with operational inefficiency due to manual management of suppliers via spreadsheets and email.
*   **Suppliers (Rajesh):** Face complex paperwork and lack digital tools to prove compliance.

### Project RayTracer Solution Architecture
*   **The "Digital Batch" (Provenance):** Moves from tracking generic volumes to specific batches using Unique Source Identifiers (USI) linked to specific mines.
*   **Automated "Supplier Passport":** Centralizes certifications into a digital passport that tracks expiry dates and automatically blocks POs if certifications lapse.
*   **Customer-Facing Transparency:** Implementation of a "Know Your Battery" section in the Ather app, allowing owners to view the origin map of the materials in their specific vehicle.
*   **Audit Readiness Toolkit:** Creation of an immutable "Evidence Vault" that stores geo-tagged photos and signed hand-offs, reducing audit prep time from weeks to hours.

### Strategic Impact
*   **Traceability:** Achieves end-to-end traceability for critical materials like cobalt and lithium.
*   **Brand Differentiation:** Validates Ather's premium positioning for environmentally conscious early adopters.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Eliminates risks of conflict minerals and child labor while ensuring regulatory compliance.
