## Project Overview

Anemia is a "silent epidemic" affecting a staggering portion of the global population. In India, the crisis is deep-rooted, with **57.2% of women of reproductive age** and **67.1% of young children** suffering from anemia.

This project was conducted during my tenure as a **Product Management Intern** at the **Centre for Digital Technologies in Healthcare (CDiTH)**.

The current "Gold Standard" for detection involves invasive blood draws and laboratory processing. While accurate, this method is invasive, costly, and does not provide immediate results. This makes mass screening in rural areas difficult.

Our goal was to explore the product landscape for **Non-Invasive Anemia Detection**—a paradigm shift toward needle-free, instant, and waste-free diagnosis. The analysis focused on market gaps, stakeholder needs, and technological viability to support national initiatives like **Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB)**.

## My Role as Product Management Intern at CDiTH

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Market Landscape Analysis** | Mapping current invasive vs. non-invasive solutions and their pros/cons. |
| **User Research & Personas** | Developing archetypes for patients, frontline workers (ASHAs), and doctors to understand pain points. |
| **Competitive Benchmarking** | Analyzing global and local competitors (e.g., Monere AI, EzeRx, Masimo) based on accuracy, cost, and portability. |
| **Strategic Gap Analysis** | Identifying why current non-invasive solutions are failing to achieve widespread clinical adoption. |

## Key Outcomes

### 1. The Paradigm Shift to Non-Invasive
The research validated the urgent need to move away from invasive methods. Non-invasive testing offers three critical advantages:
* **Zero Pain & Higher Compliance:** Removes the fear of needles, making it easier to screen children and anxious patients.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Eliminates bio-waste and consumables (strips), solving stock-out issues.
* **"Test, Treat, Talk":** Enables immediate counseling and intervention, rather than waiting days for lab results.

### 2. Stakeholder Personas
To ensure the solution fits the ecosystem, I defined three core user archetypes:
* **The Frontline Worker ("Asha"):** Needs a rugged, portable tool to screen villagers on the spot to avoid sending them to distant clinics.

* **The Patient ("Sunita"):** A daily wager who often skips testing because traveling to a clinic means losing a day's income.

* **The Doctor ("Dr. Ram"):** An overburdened medical officer who needs a clinically reliable device to empower his staff and reduce the load of unnecessary referrals.

## The Market Gap: Why Current Solutions Fail

Despite the availability of several non-invasive apps and devices, mass adoption has stalled. My analysis identified four critical gaps that a new product must address to succeed:

### 1. Clinical Reliability & Sensitivity
Most existing smartphone-based apps lack the accuracy and sensitivity required for confident clinical decisions. They are particularly weak in detecting **severe anemia**, posing a significant risk to patient safety.

### 2. Field Usability
Current solutions are often too fragile for real-world deployment. Their performance is easily compromised by environmental factors and inconsistent user handling, leading to unreliable results in the field.

### 3. The "Black Box" Problem
Clinicians are hesitant to adopt "black box" technologies where AI algorithms produce results without transparency. The sparse validation studies limit the trustworthiness of these results, making doctors reluctant to rely on them.

### 4. Regulatory & Scalability Hurdles
A major barrier is the lack of a clear path to regulatory approval (such as CDSCO or ICMR). Without these certifications, these tools cannot be formally integrated into public health programs.
