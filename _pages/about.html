<div class="about-page">
  <section class="intro">
    <p>My journey into the world of technology began in 2008, sparked by the stories of visionaries like Steve Jobs and Vinod Khosla in 'Digit Magazine'. This inspiration led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I immersed myself in programming, algorithms, and system architecture.</p>
    <p>I believe in applying theory to practice, which led me to a series of impactful internships. I tackled cybersecurity challenges with the Haryana Police, explored AI at IIT Kanpur, and delved into R&D at the Lohia Group, where I designed a solution for detecting printing defects in manufacturing.</p>
    <p>My entrepreneurial drive culminated in my first startup: a tech-enabled cafe. This venture was a masterclass in building a business from 0-to-1, from developing a pre-order app to managing nightly operations. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, leading to the strategic acquisition of our startup by a key supplier. This experience taught me more about resilience, market validation, and decision-making than any MBA ever could.</p>
    <p>As a Software Engineer at Lohia Mechatronik, I developed a web inspection system and a thickness-measuring device, further deepening my passion for product development. This passion led me to IIIT Hyderabad to pursue a Master's in Product Design and Management, formally bridging my technical expertise with business and UX principles.</p>
    <p>During my master's, I interned in Product Management at the Centre for Digital Technology in Healthcare, where I conducted research and competitive analysis for non-invasive anemia detection.</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to build products that enhance human capability and to one day start my own company. I am confident that my unique blend of engineering, product, and entrepreneurial experience will enable me to build efficient solutions for pressing societal challenges.</p>
