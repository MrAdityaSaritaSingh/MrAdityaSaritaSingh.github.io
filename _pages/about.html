<div class="about-page">
  <section class="intro">
    <p>I'm a <strong>Product Manager with an engineering background</strong> who’s driven by curiosity—always asking how
      things work, and more importantly, how they can <em>work better for people</em>. My path has been anything but
      linear: from building <strong>computer vision systems</strong> to <strong>running my own startup</strong>, each
      step has deepened my understanding of how ideas become products.</p>
    <p>My journey began in <strong>computer science</strong>, where I learned to think in systems and build from first
      principles. But I was always more interested in the <em>“why” behind the code</em>—the user, the context, the
      outcome. That curiosity led me to co-found a <strong>tech-enabled café startup</strong>. Building something from
      scratch and eventually navigating its <strong>acquisition</strong> taught me more about resilience, iteration, and
      customer understanding than any classroom could. It was, in many ways, a <em>real-world MBA</em>.</p>
    <p>Those lessons shaped how I see products today. Pursuing a <strong>Master’s in Product Design and Management at
        IIIT Hyderabad</strong> helped me bridge <em>technical execution</em> with <em>strategic thinking</em>. Since
      then, I’ve worked on everything from <strong>industrial automation software</strong> to <strong>health-tech
        research</strong>—always focusing on reducing ambiguity and moving from insight to implementation.</p>
    <p>At the core, I want to <strong>build technology that helps people solve real problems</strong>. I bring the lens
      of an engineer, the mindset of a builder, and the discipline of a product manager—working to create systems and
      products that <em>quietly make life a little easier</em>.</p>
