<div class="about-page">
  <section class="intro">
    <p>I'm a <strong>Product Manager with a background in engineering</strong>, and I love figuring out how things work so I can <em>make them work better for people</em>. My journey has been a bit unique—I've gone from building computer vision systems from scratch to launching my own startup. That experience gave me a firsthand look at <em>what it truly takes</em> to turn a cool idea into a <strong>real-world product</strong>.</p>
    <p>My career started with a deep dive into computer science, but I was always more interested in the <em>'why' behind the code</em>. That curiosity led me to co-found a tech-enabled cafe. Building a business from the ground up, and eventually navigating its acquisition, was a <strong>crash course in what really matters</strong>: understanding customers, adapting on the fly, and making tough calls. It was <em>the most practical MBA I could have asked for</em>.</p>
    <p>That experience solidified my path into product. I pursued a <strong>Master's in Product Design and Management</strong> to connect my hands-on technical skills with the <em>strategy and user empathy</em> needed to build great products. This is where I've had the chance to shape everything from industrial software to go-to-market strategies for new health-tech.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I want to <strong>build technology that helps people solve real problems</strong>. I'm looking for a role where I can use my background as an engineer, my experience as a founder, and my passion for product to create things that <em>truly make a difference</em>.</p>
