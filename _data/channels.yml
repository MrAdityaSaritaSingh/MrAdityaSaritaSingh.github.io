# Add ?ref=<slug> to any link pointing to your site.
# The slug is captured on first page load, stored for the session,
# and attached to every PostHog + GA4 event automatically.
#
# Example links:
#   Resume PDF    → https://adityasrathore.com/?ref=resume
#   LinkedIn bio  → https://adityasrathore.com/?ref=linkedin
#   Twitter post  → https://adityasrathore.com/case-studies/?ref=twitter
#   Email sig     → https://adityasrathore.com/?ref=email
#
# Standard UTM params (?utm_source=X) are also captured as fallback.
#
# Internal traffic:
#   ?internal=1   → marks browser as internal (persists via localStorage)
#   ?internal=0   → clears the flag
#   localhost      → always internal
