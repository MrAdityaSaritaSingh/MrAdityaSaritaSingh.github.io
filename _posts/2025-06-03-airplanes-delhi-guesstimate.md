## Question
**How many airplanes take off from Delhi (IGI) Airport in a single day?**

---

## Clarifying Assumptions

1. **Airport**: Only **Indira Gandhi International (IGI)** Airport
2. **Terminals**: All 3 terminals (T1, T2, T3)
3. **Runways**: 4 operational runways
4. **Timeframe**: 24 hours (full day)
5. **Scope**: Only **takeoffs** (not landings)

---

## Approach: Runway Capacity Method

### Step 1: Runway Utilization
- **Average time per aircraft on runway**: 4-5 minutes
  - Includes: Taxi to runway + Takeoff clearance + Liftoff
  - **Assumption**: 5 minutes per aircraft

### Step 2: Flights per Hour (Per Runway)
- **Flights per hour** = 60 minutes ÷ 5 minutes = **12 flights/hour**

### Step 3: Daily Capacity (Per Runway)
- **Flights per day** = 24 hours × 12 flights/hour = **288 flights/day**

### Step 4: Total Across All Runways
- **Total flights (all 4 runways)** = 4 × 288 = **1,152 flights/day**

### Step 5: Adjust for Downtime
- **Runway maintenance/low traffic hours** (midnight-5am): ~1 hour downtime per runway
- **Adjusted capacity** = 1,152 × (23/24) ≈ **1,106 flights/day**

### Step 6: Takeoffs Only
- **Assumption**: 50% takeoffs, 50% landings
- **Daily takeoffs** = 1,106 ÷ 2 ≈ **553 takeoffs**

---

## Alternative Verification: Passenger-Based Approach

### Step 1: Annual Passengers at IGI
- **IGI annual passengers** (pre-COVID): ~70 million
- **Daily passengers** = 70M ÷ 365 ≈ **192,000 passengers/day**

### Step 2: Passengers per Flight
- **Average aircraft capacity**: 150-180 seats
- **Load factor**: 80%
- **Effective passengers per flight**: 150 × 0.8 = **120 passengers**

### Step 3: Daily Flights
- **Total flights** = 192,000 ÷ 120 ≈ **1,600 flights/day**
- **Takeoffs only** = 1,600 ÷ 2 = **800 takeoffs**

---

## Final Estimate

| Method | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| **Runway Capacity** | ~550 takeoffs/day |
| **Passenger-Based** | ~800 takeoffs/day |

**Reconciled Estimate**: **600-700 takeoffs/day**

**Why the difference?**
- Runway method assumes continuous utilization (likely underestimate)
- Passenger method includes cargo flights and oversized aircraft
- **Reality**: Likely **650-700 takeoffs/day**

---

## Sanity Check

- **IGI is Asia's 2nd busiest airport** (after Dubai)
- **Comparable airports**:
  - Dubai (DXB): ~1,100 movements/day (550+ takeoffs)
  - Singapore (SIN): ~900 movements/day (450 takeoffs)
  - Mumbai (BOM): ~800 movements/day (400 takeoffs)

✅ **650-700 takeoffs** aligns with peer airports

---

## Key Assumptions Summary
1. **5 min/aircraft** on runway (industry standard)
2. **4 operational runways** (IGI actually has 3 + 1 standby)
3. **50/50 split** takeoffs vs landings
4. **23-hour utilization** (1 hour downtime for maintenance)
5. **120 passengers/flight** average (mix of domestic/international)
