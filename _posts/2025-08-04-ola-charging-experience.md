### Improving the OLA 2-Wheeler Charging Experience

#### 1. Clarifying Questions:
- **Role:** Product Manager at OLA.
- **Reason for Improvement:** Sales slump and an increase in customer complaints.
- **Focus Area:** The charging experience.

#### 2. User Segmentation:
- **Daily Commuters:** Travel < 50 km daily.
- **Heavy Users / Gig Workers:** Travel > 100 km daily.
- **Occasional Riders:** Use the scooter for leisure.

I will focus on the **daily commuters**, as they represent a large portion of the user base and are sensitive to charging anxiety.

#### 3. User Persona & Needs (Radha, a corporate employee in Bangalore):
- **Needs:**
  1.  Emergency backup power (a "reserve" mode).
  2.  A reliable, real-time list of working charging stations.
  3.  Faster charging options.
  4.  Accurate battery percentage to distance prediction.
  5.  Clear information on the type of charger available at a station.

#### 4. Prioritization & Solution:
Based on a RICE scoring, the highest priority needs are a reliable list of working stations and accurate battery prediction.

**Solution:**
- **Crowdsourced Station Data:** When a user successfully charges at a public station, the OLA app can automatically upload this data.
- **Real-time Heatmap:** Use this crowdsourced data to create a real-time map of working and available charging stations.
- **Benefits:** This would provide real-time availability, help identify high-footfall areas for future expansion, and gather data on station repair needs.
