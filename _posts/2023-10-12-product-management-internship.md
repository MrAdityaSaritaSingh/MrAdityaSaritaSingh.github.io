Through active participation in national finalist case competitions and a three-month **Product Management internship at the Centre for Digital Technology in Healthcare (CDiTH)**, where I conducted comprehensive research on Indian healthcare startup trends, mapped government and NGO initiatives, and performed **competitive analysis for non-invasive anemia detection**, yielding actionable insights for product development, I've gained invaluable real-world experience. Additionally, serving as a **Teaching Assistant for Business Fundamentals** has reinforced my understanding of core business principles, collectively shaping me into a well-rounded product professional capable of navigating the complexities of product design, development, and market strategy.
