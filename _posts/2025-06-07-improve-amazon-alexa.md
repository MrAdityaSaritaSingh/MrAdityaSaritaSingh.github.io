### My Favorite Product: Amazon Alexa

I like Alexa because it effectively addresses the pain points of creating a smart home, is easy to use with voice commands in multiple languages, and serves as a perfect desk gadget for various tasks.

### The Challenge: Improve Daily Active Users for Alexa

#### User Segmentation:
- Tech-savvy users
- Non-tech-savvy users (Kids, Youth, **Older Adults**)

I'll focus on the "Older Adults" segment, as Alexa's automation features can be highly beneficial for them.

#### User Persona & Pain Points (Amit, a retired government employee):
- **Pain Point 1:** Unfamiliar with home automation terms, making setup confusing.
- **Pain Point 2:** Unaware of the full range of Alexa's commands.
- **Pain Point 3:** Unhelpful error messages when the internet is down.

#### Proposed Solutions:
1.  **LLM-Powered Troubleshooting:** Add a troubleshooting section to the Alexa app with LLM capabilities to provide context-aware answers.
2.  **Discovery Quizzes:** Implement a quiz feature to help users discover new Alexa commands in an engaging way.
3.  ~~Video Tutorials:~~ (Lower priority due to high resource cost).

#### Key Metrics for Success (for the Quiz feature):
- **Number of features discovered per user:** Measures the effectiveness of the quizzes.
- **Usage of discovered features:** Tracks if users are adopting the features they learn about.
