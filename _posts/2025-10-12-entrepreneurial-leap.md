I am a firm believer in the **practical application of theories**, which has driven me to explore various internships that have significantly broadened my horizons. One of my earliest engagements was with **Haryana Police**, delving into cybersecurity challenges. Here, I addressed issues like cyber fraud and phishing, utilizing my expertise in computer networks and scripting to develop custom solutions. My exploration of artificial intelligence began with online courses and self-initiated projects. Following this, I secured an internship at the **Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur**. While these internships honed my technical skills with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the ultimate test of applying theory is **entrepreneurship**.

This drive culminated in my first startup, a **tech-enabled cafe** launched right outside the campus where I poured everything into building a business from **0-to-1**. It was a sprint from a simple idea—serving great coffee and rabri milk via a pre-order app—to a testament of the grind, with my days spent in engineering classes and my nights running the counter from 4 PM until after midnight. After the thrill of launching and serving our first customer, the **COVID-19 pandemic** in early 2020 created unprecedented challenges, forcing the tough but strategic decision to find the best possible home for what we had built. This journey culminated in our startup being **acquired by our key supplier**, a single year that taught me more than any MBA ever could about **resilience, market validation, and pragmatic decision-making under pressure**. That experience gave me a profound empathy for the founder’s journey, and while I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who supported us, I'm excited for the next chapter.
