### Improving Facebook Reactions to Drive Engagement

#### Background:
- **Facebook:** A platform for connecting and sharing updates.
- **Reactions (Like, Love, etc.):** A key way for users to engage with posts.
- **Goal:** Increase both adoption and engagement with the Reactions feature.

#### User Persona & Pain Points (A casual user):
- **Pain Point 1:** Cannot express the **intensity** of an emotion (e.g., "like a little" vs. "love a lot").
- **Pain Point 2:** Cannot express **mixed emotions** (e.g., bittersweet moments).
- **Pain Point 3:** The standard reactions don't always match the **context** of the post (e.g., no "Proud" reaction).

#### Proposed Solutions:
1.  **Intensity-Based Reactions:** Allow users to **press and hold** a reaction to amplify its strength. A short tap would be a mild reaction, while a longer press would signify a stronger emotion.
2.  **Layered or Mixed Reactions:** Let users combine two emotions, like "Love + Sad," to add nuance without cluttering the interface with new icons.
