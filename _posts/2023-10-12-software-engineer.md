During the COVID-19 pandemic, I dedicated myself to skill development, resulting in innovative projects like **autonomous RC cars** and **UV-C light-based house sanitization robots**. Subsequently, I applied for and secured a position in the R&D department at **Lohia Group**, India's leading manufacturer in the packaging industry. Throughout my four-month internship, I confronted real-world challenges in machine manufacturing, devising an **in-line solution for detecting printing defects**. This hands-on experience instilled in me a practical mindset, focusing on real-world effectiveness rather than fixating on over-optimized algorithms or unnecessary complexity. It also deepened my understanding of systems and how to enhance, disrupt, or adapt them. These experiences transformed me into a more pragmatic individual and further fueled my enthusiasm for the **seamless integration of hardware and software**.

Beyond the academic sphere,  I thrived in collaborative spaces, especially our collegeâ€™s **makerspace**. Here, I passionately pursued a variety of personal projects, spanning from developing innovative drones and robots.  Each of these ventures not only fueled my enthusiasm but also significantly enriched my abilities in teamwork and strategic planning.

Identifying and addressing gaps has always been my strength. This was evident when I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive **grievance management system** during my final year. Integrating web and mobile interfaces with the power of natural language processing, our team transformed the way grievances were managed, showcasing the immense potential of integrating software with everyday challenges. In the development phase, we harnessed a wide array of powerful tools and technologies, including **Python and the Django framework, MariaDB, and NLTK**. We also employed the **agile methodology** for development, ensuring efficient task allocation and continuous review throughout the integration process. This endeavor resulted in a functional system capable of processing and categorizing user grievances efficiently, elevating my expertise in web and mobile app development, server-side programming, natural language processing and  problem-solving.

Post-graduation, my role at **Lohia Mechatronik**, I've been driven by an unwavering passion for product development. As a Software Engineer there, I had the opportunity to actively contribute to developing two significant products: a **web inspection system** and a **thickness-measuring device** for plastic packaging film and sheet production. These experiences solidified my enthusiasm for bringing innovative solutions to life. In these roles, this drive continues as our team works on a **defect detection system**. This project, involving deep neural networks for classification, consolidated reporting, and operator action, has demanded extensive data handling, database management, and integration with industry-level protocols. While we've achieved significant success, it's underscored my motivation to explore more advanced machine learning models and expertise, particularly in areas like **computer vision deployment** and **fault-tolerant architectures**, to continually push the boundaries of product innovation.
