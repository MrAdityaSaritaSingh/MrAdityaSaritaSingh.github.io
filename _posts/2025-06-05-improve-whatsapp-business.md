### Improving WhatsApp for Small Businesses

#### Background:
- **WhatsApp:** A mature, free messaging platform for individuals and groups.
- **WhatsApp Business:** An offering for brands to communicate with their user base for promotion, customer support, and engagement.
- **Goal:** Focus on improving WhatsApp Business for revenue generation, specifically for small businesses (MSMEs).

#### User Persona & Pain Points:
Let's consider a local vendor who uses WhatsApp to receive and manage orders.
- **Pain Point 1:** It's hard to keep track of all incoming orders.
- **Pain Point 2:** There are no intelligent or automated reply mechanisms.
- **Pain Point 3:** Customers have no idea when they will receive their order.

#### Proposed Solutions:
1.  **Basic Sales Funnel:** Introduce a simple sales funnel within WhatsApp to track orders from placement to delivery.
2.  **Intelligent Replies:** Implement bots that can reply to users with available items or raise a request for items not in stock.
3.  **Live Location Sharing:** Allow the vendor to share their live location with the customer when they are out for delivery.

#### Prioritization (RICE Framework):
- **Sales Funnel:** Reach=4, Impact=2, Confidence=3, Effort=4
- **Intelligent Replies:** Reach=4, Impact=2, Confidence=3, Effort=4
- **Live Location:** (Not scored, but a potential feature)

Based on this, the sales funnel and intelligent replies are high-priority features to explore.
