## Question
**How many Toyota Fortuners are currently registered in Gurgaon, Haryana?**

## Clarifying the Problem
We're estimating the **total number of Fortuners in Gurgaon, HR** that are currently registered (not annual sales).

**Timeframe**: Assuming average car lifespan of **10-12 years** (2013-2025)

## Bottom-Up Calculation

### Step 1: Total Vehicles in India
- **Total registered vehicles in India**: 35 crore (350 million)
- **% of 4-wheelers**: 16%
- **Number of 4-wheelers**: 5.6 crore (56 million)

### Step 2: Personal vs Commercial
- **Number of personal 4-wheelers**: 5.6 cr × 85% = **4.5 crore**
  *(Assumption: 85% personal, 15% commercial/taxi)*

### Step 3: SUV Penetration
- **% of SUVs**: 25%  
  *(Assumption: Higher percentage due to recent craze for mini-SUVs like Creta, Venue, etc.)*
- **Total SUVs in India**: 4.5 cr × 25% = **1.2 crore** (12 million)

### Step 4: Full-Size SUVs
- **% of SUVs > 4m length**: 20%  
  *(Compact SUVs like Creta, Seltos dominate; only premium segment goes full-size)*
- **Number of SUVs > 4m**: 1.2 cr × 20% = **24 lakh** (2.4 million)

### Step 5: Premium Full-Size SUVs
- **% of full-size that are premium**: 20%  
  *(Brands: Toyota Fortuner, MG Gloster, Ford Endeavour, Mahindra Alturas)*
- **Number of full-size premium SUVs**: 24 lakh × 20% = **4.8 lakh**

### Step 6: Fortuner Market Share
- **Fortuner's market share in full-size premium SUVs**: 70%  
  *(Fortuner dominates this segment in India)*
- **Total Fortuners in India**: 4.8 lakh × 70% = **3.4 lakh** (340,000)

### Step 7: Haryana Allocation
- **Haryana's population**: ~2% of India
- **Adjusted for wealth/luxury car density**: 3%  
  *(Gurgaon, Faridabad are NCR cities with higher purchasing power)*
- **Fortuners in Haryana**: 3.4 lakh × 3% = **10,200**

### Step 8: Gurgaon Concentration
- **Gurgaon as % of Haryana's luxury car market**: 80%  
  *(Gurgaon is the commercial/corporate hub of Haryana)*
- **Fortuners in Gurgaon**: 10,200 × 80% = **~8,160**

## Final Answer
**Approximately 8,000-8,200 Toyota Fortuners** are currently registered in Gurgaon.

## Key Assumptions
1. **Car lifespan**: 10-12 years (newer models dominate due to premium segment)
2. **SUV craze**: 25% of personal cars are SUVs (India trend)
3. **Fortuner dominance**: 70% market share in full-size premium SUV segment
4. **Gurgaon wealth**: 3% of India's Fortuners in Haryana (vs 2% population share)
5. **Urban concentration**: 80% of Haryana's luxury cars in Gurgaon

## Sanity Check
- **Gurgaon population**: ~1.5 million
- **Fortuners per capita**: ~5 per 1,000 people
- **Seems reasonable** for a premium SUV in an affluent NCR city
