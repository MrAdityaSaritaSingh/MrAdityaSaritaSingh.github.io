> Steve Jobs once said, "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."

This philosophy resonates deeply with my journey. 

In 2008, as a young tech enthusiast and a fervent reader of **'Digit Magazine'**, I encountered stories of visionaries like Steve Jobs and Vinod Khosla. Their stories **ignited my passion** for building both software and hardware products, compelling me to dive deep into the universe of creation and innovation. My pursuit of knowledge in computer science became the backbone of my career, eventually leading me to  pursua a bachelor's degree in computer science. This academic foundation opened the door to a career as a software engineer in the Industrial machinery sector, where I discovered the exciting **convergence of software and machinery**. My professional experiences became the catalyst for my academic ambitions, driving me to seek a master of product design and management at IIIT hyderabad.
