As I reflect on my academic journey and professional experiences spanning three years, I believe that playing on our strengths is critical and can contribute significantly to society. Likewise,  contributing to the species' advancement by being at the **forefront of engineering-related research** with interdisciplinary thinking, using first principles, strong pattern-matching, and identifying solutions in critical situations. So after graduating, I plan to join a company that aligns with my interests to work in a research-oriented private firm or an institution related to the subject. I am drawn to the place where I can apply my skills to real-world projects and learn from it. But my ultimate goal is to **start my own company** and utilize my expertise and to further propagate the planet and aim to develop products that **increase human capability at work**, support systems for assisting elderly and specially abled people. In conclusion, I am confident that your program will equip me with the necessary skills to build efficient solutions that address pressing societal challenges.
